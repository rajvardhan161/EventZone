🛠️ Customization Tips
Replace placeholders
Change your-username/eventzone-frontend.git to your real repository URL.

Features list
Add real features from your app (e.g., booking, user profiles, admin panel).

Screenshots / GIFs
Add images under Features or Demo sections to showcase UI.

Environment variables
If your app uses API keys or .env, include .env.example instructions.

If you want, I can generate a README with badges, screenshots, and a table of contents too — just tell me your stack (React, Tailwind, backend used, authentication, API endpoints).
